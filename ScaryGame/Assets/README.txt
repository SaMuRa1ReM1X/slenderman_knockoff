Thanks allot to the following:
Unity Developers! For their awesome Dynamic Shadows Demo and the scripts they included for us all to benefit from.

NoteSystem -THANKS TO CharlesD from Unity Answers site and GalenEvil from Unity3D IRC channel.

Dynamic Doors, sound and key system shout out to Combatdave.

Final Notes: I really hope someone finds this useful. I know it can be tough finding the answers your looking for, we are not all programmers and sometimes can lose hope that anyone will ever give us a helping hand. I dont subscribe to the whole "I'm NOT doing YOUR homework" attitude. This is a community and many of us are hobbyist's. I hope this renews some of your hope that there are those of us that care to help. Even if its something simple. ON THAT NOTE though like I said, these are things I found, got answers to, etc. I am not a programmer myself and if you have any issues or problems try to reach out on the Answers site or the Unity IRC channel. I know almost next to nothing. This is just an attempt to share what I have found so far. This project is a great, if not simple start to you making a fun FPS horror game or whatever you can think of. Have fun! Learn! Enjoy! And pay it forward. 

~Majestic & Others.
